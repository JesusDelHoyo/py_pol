How to use py_pol
=========

This page contains more in-depth guides for using py_pol. It is divided into tutorials and examples.

The tutorials show examples of how to use each one of the main classes: Jones_vector, Jones_matrix, Stokes and Mueller. There is a fifth tutorial showing the possibilities of graphical representation of light states (Jones_vector and Stokes objects): drawings.

The examples section is itself divided into basic and advanced. The basic examples show some straightforward examples to start to use py_pol. The advanced examples present some insights into polarization physics and the more advanced capabilities for py_pol.
